        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This subject has explained how computers were built in the past and how they have evolved into the systems we use today. It teaches us about the technologies used throughout history and those being implemented right now. As future engineers, this allows us to understand how a computer works so we can make it operate as efficiently as possible. Furthermore, the course has provided us with practical knowledge in Git, CSS, and HTML.</p>
